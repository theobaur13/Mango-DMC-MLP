# Mango-DMC-MLP (Mango Dry Matter Content Multilayer Perceptron)

A neural network model that predicts the dry matter content of mangos based off of near-infrared spectroscopy absorbance data.

## Data

This model uses data from the [mango-dmc](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/46htwnp833/1) dataset, provided by Anderson et al. 2020.
